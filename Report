# Metasploitable2 Findings

### Introduction

I started by creating a Metasploitable2 VirtualBox VM.
- Metasploitable2 VM IP address: 10.0.2.4
After doing some research I found that many people use Kali Linux to do their penetration testing on Metasploitable2, so I also created a Kali Linux VirutalBox VM. 
I also learned that a free version of Nessus can be used to perform a scan on Metasploitable2 to highlight any vulnerabilties that I may be able to exploit, so I went 
ahead and installed Nessus on my Kali Linux VM and once it was up and running I did a basic network scan as well as an advanced network scan with both returning 
~ 72 vulnerabilities. 

Goal: Create a script that, once run, will configure your server and user directory to your custom preferences. This script will be the only thing to run on a new system. Internal to the script should be any service restarts needed - a user should not need to do any additional action.
- For the VIM plugin, NERDTree https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree.git

### Project 1-2

Goal: This project will be using your script from Project 1 to create & resolve issues via GitHub
- Create issues associated with the feedback given on the rubric.
- Create a git usage guide called Git-Guide.md in the main folder of your repository
